        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Destin Nguyen and I am currently a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Psychology because of my passion for trying to understand people. I am 19 years old and I was born and raised in San Jose, California. I am fluent in both English and Vietnamese. I am currently seeking a job opportunity that will be able to help me grow as a person and give me the proper experience I will need for the future. I am a very hard working individual that aims for nothing but perfection. I believe in punctuality and efficiency. The two rules I grew up with were: if you are early, you are on time, but if you are on time, you are late, and work smarter not harder. These two phrases have been instilled in me from when I was very young and it has stuck with me since. <br><br>

        I have a variety of job experiences that I have attained over the past few years. I started off working at a milk tea shop during my sophomore year of high school, where I learned the skills to be both a barista and a cashier. This job helped me learn to be efficient because most of my shifts were solo shifts. I had to take orders and make drinks at the same time. During my junior year in high school, I was offered a job for a big insurance company: Allstate, where I would be a customer service representative. I learned a lot of great communication skills here and it has helped me a lot with better understanding of how to talk to customers. Lastly, my senior year of high school was where I got a job in the restaurant industry. I started out as a busser for an all you can eat korean barbeque restaurant named Gen. Then very quickly, I was able to move up to a server position because of my incredible work habits. <br><br>

        In my spare time, I like to work out a lot not only to keep my body in shape, but my mind too. Also to work out my mind, I tend to spend a lot of time reading motivating books and my current favorite author would have to be Robert Greene. I also skateboard and work on my car a lot as well. But what makes me truly happy, is being able to socialize and meet new people. I am a very friendly person and I treat everyone with the same amount of respect. My greatest strength would have to be my leadership ability. I tend to be the person that steps up and leads. This strength comes from my history of leadership experiences. These experiences range from being an Eagle Scout to being the President of the Associated Student Body at my high school. Again, I am seeking a job that will help me gain the experience needed for my future and to teach me things to help me grow into a stronger individual.
